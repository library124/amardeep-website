# SOLID Payment Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the SOLID-compliant payment system architecture implemented for the portfolio application. The refactoring addresses violations of SOLID principles in the original codebase and provides a maintainable, extensible, and testable payment processing system.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **PaymentGateway**: Only handles communication with payment providers
- **PaymentRepository**: Only handles payment data persistence
- **PaymentValidator**: Only handles payment validation logic
- **PaymentProcessor**: Only orchestrates payment processing workflow
- **PaymentHandler**: Only handles post-payment actions
- **NotificationService**: Only handles sending notifications

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The system is open for extension but closed for modification:

- New payment gateways can be added by implementing `IPaymentGateway`
- New payment types can be added without modifying existing code
- New notification methods can be added by implementing `INotificationService`
- New post-payment handlers can be added by implementing `IPostPaymentHandler`

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces:

- Any `IPaymentGateway` implementation can replace another
- Any `INotificationService` implementation can replace another
- All handlers implement the same `IPostPaymentHandler` interface

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are focused and don't force implementations to depend on unused methods:

- `IPaymentGateway` only defines payment gateway operations
- `INotificationService` only defines notification operations
- `IValidationService` only defines validation operations

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:

- `PaymentProcessor` depends on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- `PaymentService` injects dependencies through constructor
- All dependencies can be mocked for testing

## Architecture Components

### Core Interfaces (`interfaces.py`)

```python
# Key interfaces that define contracts
- IPaymentGateway: Payment gateway operations
- IPaymentRepository: Data access operations
- IPaymentProcessor: Payment processing logic
- IPostPaymentHandler: Post-payment actions
- INotificationService: Notification operations
- IValidationService: Validation logic
```

### Payment Gateways (`gateways.py`)

```python
# Gateway implementations
- BeeceptorPaymentGateway: Mock gateway for testing
- RazorpayGateway: Real Razorpay integration
- PaymentGatewayFactory: Creates gateway instances
```

### Data Access Layer (`repositories.py`)

```python
# Repository implementations
- PaymentRepository: Payment data operations
- ItemRepository: Item (course/workshop/service) operations
```

### Validation Services (`validators.py`)

```python
# Validation implementations
- PaymentValidationService: General payment validation
- WorkshopValidationService: Workshop-specific validation
- ServiceValidationService: Service-specific validation
```

### Business Logic (`processors.py`)

```python
# Core business logic
- PaymentProcessor: Orchestrates payment workflow
```

### Post-Payment Handlers (`handlers.py`)

```python
# Post-payment action handlers
- CoursePaymentHandler: Handles course enrollment
- WorkshopPaymentHandler: Handles workshop registration
- ServicePaymentHandler: Handles service booking
- PaymentHandlerFactory: Creates appropriate handlers
```

### Notification Services (`notifications.py`)

```python
# Notification implementations
- EmailNotificationService: Email notifications
- SMSNotificationService: SMS notifications (placeholder)
- NotificationServiceFactory: Creates notification services
```

### Service Facade (`service.py`)

```python
# Main service facade
- PaymentService: Provides simplified interface for payment operations
```

### View Layer (`payment_views_solid.py`)

```python
# SOLID-compliant views
- BasePaymentView: Common functionality
- CreateCourseOrderView: Course payment endpoint
- CreateWorkshopOrderView: Workshop payment endpoint
- CreateServiceOrderView: Service payment endpoint
- PaymentSuccessView: Payment completion endpoint
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Course Payment

```python
# Using the service layer
payment_service = PaymentService()
response = payment_service.create_course_order(
    course_id="123",
    user=request.user,
    email="user@example.com"
)

if response.success:
    return JsonResponse({
        'order_id': response.order_id,
        'payment_id': response.payment_id,
        'amount': response.amount
    })
```

### Adding a New Payment Gateway

```python
# Implement the interface
class StripeGateway(IPaymentGateway):
    def create_order(self, request: PaymentRequest):
        # Stripe-specific implementation
        pass
    
    def verify_payment(self, completion_request: PaymentCompletionRequest):
        # Stripe-specific verification
        pass

# Update factory
class PaymentGatewayFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_gateway(gateway_type: str):
        if gateway_type == "stripe":
            return StripeGateway()
        # ... existing gateways
```

### Adding a New Payment Type

```python
# Add to enum
class PaymentType(Enum):
    SUBSCRIPTION = "subscription"  # New type

# Create handler
class SubscriptionPaymentHandler(IPostPaymentHandler):
    def handle_successful_payment(self, payment, item, item_type):
        # Subscription-specific logic
        pass

# Update factory
class PaymentHandlerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_handler(item_type: PaymentType):
        if item_type == PaymentType.SUBSCRIPTION:
            return SubscriptionPaymentHandler()
        # ... existing handlers
```

## Benefits of SOLID Architecture

### 1. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to locate and fix bugs
- Changes in one component don't affect others

### 2. Testability
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Dependencies can be easily mocked
- Comprehensive test coverage possible

### 3. Extensibility
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- New payment gateways, types, and handlers can be plugged in
- System grows organically

### 4. Flexibility
- Components can be swapped out easily
- Different configurations for different environments
- A/B testing of different implementations

### 5. Code Reusability
- Common interfaces allow code reuse
- Handlers can be reused across different contexts
- Validation logic is centralized

## Migration from Legacy Code

### Before (Violations)
```python
# Single class doing everything
class PaymentView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        # Validation logic
        # Gateway communication
        # Database operations
        # Business logic
        # Notification sending
        # All mixed together
```

### After (SOLID Compliant)
```python
# Separated concerns
class CreateCourseOrderView(BasePaymentView):
    def post(self, request):
        # Only handles HTTP concerns
        response = self.payment_service.create_course_order(...)
        return self.handle_payment_response(response)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each component tested in isolation
- Mocked dependencies
- High code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Database integration
- Gateway integration

### End-to-End Tests
- Full payment workflow
- Real gateway testing (in staging)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```python
# Gateway configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID = "your_key_id"
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = "your_key_secret"

# Notification configuration
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "noreply@yoursite.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@yoursite.com"
```

### Service Configuration
```python
# Different configurations for different environments
payment_service = PaymentService(
    gateway_type="beeceptor",  # Use mock for development
    notification_type="email"
)

# Production configuration
payment_service = PaymentService(
    gateway_type="razorpay",   # Use real gateway
    notification_type="email"
)
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- If gateway fails, fallback to mock
- If notifications fail, payment still processes
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Error Recovery
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Dead letter queues for failed notifications
- Manual intervention capabilities

## Performance Considerations

### Async Processing
- Notifications sent asynchronously
- Post-payment actions can be queued
- Non-blocking payment processing

### Caching
- Gateway responses cached
- Validation results cached
- Database queries optimized

## Security

### Payment Security
- Gateway signature verification
- Secure credential storage
- PCI compliance considerations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption
- Audit trails
- Access controls

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Structured logging throughout
- Payment workflow tracking
